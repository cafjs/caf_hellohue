## Hello Hue

Watch a video of this app [here](https://youtu.be/VwRbf2DOGUk)

Controlling a Philips Hue Bluetooth Color bulb with just a browser that supports the Web Bluetooth API, e.g., Chrome. Share a URL for remote and simultaneous interactions with the bulb. Keep AR and VR views (webXR) in sync with reality.

Note that for security reasons the Philips Hue bulb will not allow more than one client pairing and bonding with it at the same time. Therefore, in order to change bridging devices, use the official app to force pairing, update firmware (highly recommended), and then reset to factory settings the bulb.

You may need to plug/unplug the bulb to make it discoverable.
